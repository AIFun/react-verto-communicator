# Component Name:  < component name \>   #
# 1. Functional Description #
(REMOVE WHEN DONE)

 Write a brief description of what this component will do, how it is intended to be used, etc.  This description should give the reader a high level idea of what the component development requirements are.

 Sample:
*This component will be a text input control that will invoke a callback function when the enter/return key is pressed by the user.  When the enter key is pressed, the input field will be cleared and will retain focus.  The input must be contained in div that has rounded corners at the bottom and square corners at the top so it can be aligned with another component.  Default styling should include font-size, line-height, color, border-radius, margin and padding for the input, and for the container, background-color, border, and border-radius.  The default styles should be overridable via props in part or in their entirety.  Placeholder text value is passed in using props.*
