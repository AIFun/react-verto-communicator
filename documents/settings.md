# 3. Component Type #

This is a â€˜pure' component.

## a. Required Props ##

If the prop is an object, a sample of the object structure needs to be provided.
If the prop is a callback function, then a sample of the function call including input arguments and their data types must be provided.  If an argument is an object, then a sample of its structure must be provided.

Sample:

| Prop Name | Sample | Description |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| placeHolder | "..." | _Include a brief description of what the prop does as well as whether it is required or not and its' type_ |
| styles |  _NOTE styles are in JSX, not CSX_ { inputWrapStyle: {backgroundColor: '#ddd'} inputStyle {fontSize: '1rem'} }m | Sample: |
| cbClick |  _Function implemented and bound to a higher-order parent container of this component_ | This prop is a string and is required. This prop is passed into this component from the session component and controls what message we display to the user. |

## b. Component State ##

This component will maintain it's own state for dropdownDisplayed.

This component is a drop down menu and will toggle between up and down based on click of a button(SettingsIconSVG).
Initial state:
State = {menuDown: false}  // menu is initially 'up'
onClick of button
	// set menuDown to the inverse of its current value
this.setState({...this.state, menuDown: !this.state.menuDown});

## c .Component Events ##

If the component needs to react to events (clicks, key presses, etc.) then those events should be listed here along with the action that should be taken:

Sample:

Event | Action(s)
------------ | -------------
Settings icon clicked | Invoke the callback function cbClick(), dropdownDisplayed state is toggled.

## d. Context-Aware Specification ##
